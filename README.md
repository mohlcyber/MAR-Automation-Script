# McAfee Active Response (MAR) Automation Script

This is a script that will search for systems based on a specific hash and will automatically remove these files.
This is a small example. Of course other reactions could be used as well.

Usage:
```
mar_api.py [-h] -i EPOIP -p EPOPORT -U EPOUSERNAME -P EPOPASSWORD -H HASH
```

!!! Will add the check for file status soon.

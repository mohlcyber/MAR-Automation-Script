# McAfee Active Response (MAR) Automation Script

This is a script that will search for systems based on a specific hash and will automatically remove these files.
This is a small example. Of course other reactions could be used as well.

Usage:
```
mar_api.py [-h] --epoip EPOIP --epoport EPOPORT --epousername EPOUSERNAME --epopassword EPOPASSWORD --hash HASH
```
